# Projectify

**Projectify** is a project management tool, like trello, that helps track progress of a project.
You create a project board and add members to the board. You then create lists in boards which then contains tasks to be completed.
You can assign members in the board a task in list and set a due date for the task. You can set different color labels for different tasks in the list.
